To run the JaBeJa version of each of the branches, the default settings of Delta and Temperature should be changed accordingly in the configuration file.

SimulatedAnnealing-NoAP       -> Delta = 0.01, Temperature = 2

SimulatedAnnealing-Restart    -> Delta = 0.01, Temperature = 2

SimulatedAnnealing-AP         -> Delta = 0.01, Temperature = 1

SimulatedAnnealing-AP-Restart -> Delta = 0.01, Temperature = 1
